! * Semantic Notes

! ** Type declarations and dispatch
! There is a chicken-and-egg situation to solve.  With regards to semantic
! subtyping, a value having a certain type means that this value fulfills certain
! properties.  If these properties are to be reasoned about, they must become
! apparent during inference at the correct positions.  There are several cases to
! consider

! *** Explicit predicate words
!     This is the most obvious case: If a ~foo?~ word of class ~foo~ is
!     encountered, the expanded instance check's predicates are inferred for
!     composition, ususally resulting in an Xor type.

! *** Typed Definitions
!     These are explicitly defined to have coercing behaviour with regards to the
!     input classes.  However, the implementation suggests that this is actually
!     delegated to ~declare~?

! *** Default input/output types
!     Primitive words have these defined per fiat power.  They are basically used
!     to "bootstrap" type checking by having default instance assumptions to work with.

! *** Dispatch
!     This is like typed definitions, but the dispatch process is stateful.  Thus,
!     the strategy is to actually follow the predicate decision path.

! ** The Role of Declarations
!    On one hand, declarations are nominative, i.e. we simply state that a value
!    belongs to a certain type.  On the other hand, declarations are used like
!    refinements.

! ** Nominative vs. predicative/semantic types
!    Declarations are kept as nominative declarations.  Instance predicates are
!    used on the semantic level.   This means we can keep reasoning on a nominative
!    level, while expanding e.g predicates to have the desired effect.

! * Compositional approach

! ** Effect Type
! An effect type would represent a typed Factor Effect
! ~( ..a x: integer y: number -- y x ..a )~  as
! #+begin_example factor
! P{ Effect L{ ?y ?x . ?a } L{ ?x ?y ?z . ?a } {
!   P{ Instance ?x integer }
!   P{ Instance ?y number }
!   }
! }
! #+end_example
! This is equivalent with the following logical expression:
! For all x, y, a, b: If the input matches the given form:
! - The output matches the given form
! - The value x is an instance of integer
! - The value y is an instance of number
! - We know nothing about the value ?z

! Problem: ~z~ could be interpreted as an existential variable, but also as a universally
! quantified one.  This is most interesting for union types, e.g. for the
! ~[ swap ] when~ example, where the union type of ~( x y -- y x )~ and
! ~( ..b -- ..b )~ has to be calculated.

! Now this is a bit problematic, concerning the semantics.
! The intersection check can be performed if we assume the same inputs, so firs we
! unify ~L{ ?y ?x . ?a } ==! ?b~.  This creates the following Effect Types:
! #+begin_example factor
! P{ Effect L{ ?y ?x . ?a } L{ ?x ?y . ?a } }
! P{ Effect L{ ?y ?x . ?a } L{ ?y ?x . ?a } }
! #+end_example

! Note that for making an intersection type, unification of this would actually be
! possible, and return the side condition that ~?x = ?y~.  However, the output
! stack itself can actually be considered a dependent type of the input stack.  In
! order for these to have the chance to intersect, they must be Î±-equivalent under
! the input stack bindings. (There can be existentials in the outputs)
